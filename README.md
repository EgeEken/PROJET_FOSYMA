# PROJET_FOSYMA
The final project for my FOSYMA (Fondaments des Syst√®mes Multi-Agents) class

## Report
The report is in the EKEN_RAPPORT.pdf file. The latex code for the report is in EKEN_RAPPORT.tex.

## Code
The code is written in Java, using the JADE / DEDALE framework. All of the code is in the eu.su.mas.dedale-eu-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT folder. To run the code, you need to initialize the project with Maven on Eclipse, then run the Principal.java file in the src/main/java/eu/su/mas/dedaleEtu/princ/ folder.

Principal.java is the main simulation, which features 2 Explorer agents, 2 Gold Collector agents, 2 Diamond Collector agents, and 1 Tanker (Silo) agent. 
Principal2.java is a simulation with 1 of each agent type instead of 2.
